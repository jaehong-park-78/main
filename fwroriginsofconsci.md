“Consciousness is not a product of the brain; it is a wave phenomenon that arises when the heart’s rhythm is transmitted to the brain and resonates with it. The biological fact that the heart forms before the brain suggests that the origin of consciousness lies in the central life-flow of the heart (F). The brain functions as a wave generator that attunes itself to this flow, and consciousness emerges when the heart’s flow and the brain’s waves enter into resonance (R).”
