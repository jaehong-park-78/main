Flow: The infant’s sensory impulses—hunger, discomfort, pleasure—represent the internal bodily ‘flow’ attempting to manifest.

Wave: These impulses become patterned sounds—babbling, rhythm, intonation, crying—transforming the sensations into waves.

Resonance: The parent responds—smiling, talking back, cuddling—creating reciprocal feedback through resonance.

This interaction repeats, establishing the proto-structure of language, and during this process, a semantic network forms in the infant’s brain.
In other words, language is essentially an FWR-based resonant circuit.
