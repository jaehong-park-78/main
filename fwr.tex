\begin{abstract}
The \textbf{Flow-Wave-Resonance (FWR) Ontology} presents a dynamic model of being, integrating three core elements: \textbf{Flow}, \textbf{Wave}, and \textbf{Resonance}. Departing from traditional static ontologies, this model conceptualizes being as a relational, ever-changing phenomenon within temporal processes. The FWR Ontology offers a unified framework applicable across scales—from individual experiences to cosmic phenomena—synthesizing Western process philosophy and Eastern dependent origination in a modern context.

\section{Introduction}
Traditional Western metaphysics, from Plato’s theory of Forms to Aristotle’s substance theory, has viewed being as a static, immutable essence. In contrast, 20th-century thinkers like Alfred North Whitehead and Martin Heidegger reframed being as a temporal, processual phenomenon. Similarly, Eastern philosophies such as Buddhist dependent origination and Daoist principles of the Dao have long emphasized interdependence and dynamism.

The \textbf{FWR Ontology} proposes that existence (E) emerges from the interaction of three dimensions—\textbf{Flow (F)}, \textbf{Wave (W)}, and \textbf{Resonance (R)}—within a temporal framework, denoted as E(t). This model is not merely philosophical but serves as a practical framework for understanding phenomena at individual, social, and physical levels.

\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Lineage of Process Philosophy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Whitehead’s Process Philosophy}: In \textit{Process and Reality} (1929), Alfred North Whitehead describes reality as a series of “actual entities” formed through “prehension,” aligning with the FWR model’s resonance concept.
    \item \textbf{Bergson’s Durée}: Henri Bergson’s concept of qualitative time as a flow informs the Flow dimension.
    \item \textbf{Deleuze’s Rhizome}: Gilles Deleuze’s non-linear, interconnected view of being complements the FWR model’s relational structure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contribution of Eastern Philosophy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Buddhist Dependent Origination}: The principle that existence arises from interdependent conditions (“When this exists, that exists”) underpins the resonance concept.
    \item \textbf{Daoist Dao}: The Dao, described by Laozi as dynamic and inexpressible (“The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao”), aligns with the FWR model’s temporal function E(t).
\end{itemize}

\hrule

\section{Structure of the FWR Model}

\subsection{Basic Formula}
The FWR Ontology is formalized through the following equations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phenomenal Realm}:
    $$
    E(t) = F(t) \times W(t) \times R(t)
    $$
    \item \textbf{Potential Realm}:
    $$
    \alpha(F, W, R) = a \cdot F(t) + b \cdot \sin(W(t)) + c \cdot R(t)
    $$
    \item \textbf{Total Existence}:
    $$
    E_{\text{total}}(t) = E(t) + \alpha(F, W, R)
    $$
\end{itemize}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $E(t)$: Existence at time $t$.
    \item $F(t)$: Flow, representing energy and information movement.
    \item $W(t)$: Wave, embodying rhythms and patterns.
    \item $R(t)$: Resonance, reflecting relational connections and amplification.
    \item $\alpha$: Potential for “hidden” existence, where $\alpha \geq 0$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Flow (F) Dimension}
Flow is the vectorial force driving existence, akin to Bergson’s \textit{élan vital}, defined as:
$$
F(t) = (V(t) - R_s(t)) \times K(t) \times e^{(-D \times t)}
$$
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V(t)$: Vector of will and energy.
    \item $R_s(t)$: Resistance (internal conflicts or external barriers).
    \item $K(t)$: Concentration at critical moments.
    \item $D$: Energy decay rate.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Types of Flow}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linear Flow}: Stable, predictable (e.g., routines, institutional processes).
    \item \textbf{Turbulent Flow}: Unpredictable, creative (e.g., brainstorming, artistic inspiration).
    \item \textbf{Flexible Flow}: Adaptive, curvilinear (e.g., conversations, natural growth).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wave (W) Dimension}
Wave represents periodic structures forming rhythms across biological, social, and historical contexts:
$$
W(t) = A(t) \times \sin(\omega t + \phi) + \sum \text{harmonics}
$$
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A(t)$: Amplitude over time.
    \item $\omega$: Frequency (periodicity of emotions, actions).
    \item $\phi$: Phase (synchronization degree).
    \item $\text{harmonics}$: Complex wave harmony.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Types of Waves}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Regular Wave}: Stable patterns (e.g., breathing, daily routines).
    \item \textbf{Irregular Wave}: Sudden changes (e.g., emotional outbursts, unforeseen events).
    \item \textbf{Stable Wave}: Sustained patterns (e.g., meditative states).
    \item \textbf{Complex Wave}: Multi-layered rhythms (e.g., urban noise, social phenomena).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Resonance (R) Dimension}
Resonance is the core process where flows and waves interact to create new order and meaning:
$$
R(t) = \sum [F_i(t) \times W_j(t) \times C_{ij}(t)]
$$
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $C_{ij}(t)$: Coupling strength between entities $i$ and $j$.
    \item $\sum$: Sum of multiple relationships.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sub-components}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resonance Frequency}: Number of meaningful connections per unit time.
    \item \textbf{Resonance Direction}: Cooperative (constructive) or conflictual (destructive).
    \item \textbf{Resonance Accumulation}: Persistent structures (e.g., trust, traditions).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Practical Extended Forms}
$$
E(t) = F(t) \cdot f(W(t)) \cdot g(R(t))
$$
Where $f$ and $g$ are transformable functions (e.g., sin, cos, tanh) tailored to specific contexts.

\section{Six-Stage Model of Resonance Phases}
Resonance unfolds through six qualitative stages of relational change:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Preservation Phase (1 + 1 = 2)}
    Entities coexist independently, maintaining clear boundaries (e.g., courteous relationships).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Characteristics: Mutual non-interference, stable equilibrium.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Fusion Phase (1 + 1 = 1)}
    Entities merge into a single entity (e.g., team cohesion, romantic bonds).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Characteristics: Boundary dissolution, emergence of a new entity.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Generation Phase (1 + 1 = 3)}
    A new entity emerges from interaction (e.g., biological reproduction, creative ideas).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Characteristics: Emergent properties, unpredictability.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Separation Phase (1 = 0.5 + 0.5)}
    A unified entity differentiates (e.g., social group splits, tissue differentiation).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Characteristics: Specialization, new relational possibilities.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Dissolution Phase (1 $\to \epsilon$)}
    Existence fades, leaving subtle traces (e.g., fading memories, evaporation).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Characteristics: Weakening substance, potential for restoration.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Annihilation Phase (1 $\to 0$)}
    Complete erasure or disconnection (e.g., data deletion, forgotten events).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Characteristics: Conscious forgetting, prerequisite for new beginnings.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hrule

\section{Relational Construction of Truth}
Truth (T) is the temporal accumulation of resonance:
$$
T = \int R(t) \, dt
$$
This implies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trust Formation}: Trust emerges from repeated positive interactions.
    \item \textbf{Scientific Truth}: Laws and theories gain validity through experimental resonance.
    \item \textbf{Cultural Truth}: Traditions and arts form through collective resonance.
    \item \textbf{Personal Truth}: Individual insights arise from self-world resonance.
\end{itemize}

\hrule
