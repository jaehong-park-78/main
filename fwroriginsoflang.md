### The Origin of Language in Infants (FWR Interpretation)

#### 1. Flow  
From the moment of birth, an infant possesses the biological rhythm of the heartbeat—**Flow**.  

This heartbeat manifests as an outflow of energy through various sensory expressions (facial expressions, gestures, cries, skin tension, etc.).  

In essence, the infant’s entire body is a living fountain, channeling the internal flow of life outward.

#### 2. Wave  
This flow is not random; it begins to take on rhythm and patterns.  

Babbling (vocalization), gestures, and facial expressions are initial attempts to transform internal flow into **waves**.  

In other words, babbling is an experimental playground for sensation, rhythm, and consciousness. The infant is testing phase alignment with the world.

#### 3. Resonance  
Parents respond to these waves—they smile, hold, or mimic the infant.  

This creates a **resonance circuit**, and the infant’s brain learns phase synchronization through this feedback.  

Thus, language emerges through the sequence: **heart → sensation → wave → resonance → structured symbolic system**.

### 🧠 Core Philosophy  
> “Language is the trace of waves, unfurled by the heartbeat to resonate with the world.”  
> “An infant’s babbling is the universe’s first poem.”

### 🔄 Connecting Thread  
- **Crying** = Survival-driven **Flow** (direct outflow).  
- **Babbling** = Experimental **Wave** (phase testing).  
- **Parental Response** = **Resonant** Feedback (conscious connection).  
→ Ultimately, language grows and refines within the **FWR loop**.
